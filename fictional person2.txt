Emily Harper, an out-of-state student from a small coastal town in New Jersey, who’s always felt a deep connection to the ocean. With her passion for marine biology and a love for the environment, Emily has set her sights on the University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW) for its renowned marine science program. Growing up surrounded by nature, she’s drawn to Wilmington’s scenic coastal environment, where she can easily pursue her hobbies of surfing and beach volleyball.

Emily prefers the intimacy of a middle size, community-oriented campus where she can form close-knit relationships with her professors and peers. She’s excited about the idea of living on campus, ideally in a suite where she can have her own bedroom while still being part of a vibrant student community. Emily values her personal space but enjoys being close to campus activities and, of course, the beach.

When it comes to food, Emily has a taste for variety—she loves healthy, fresh options and would appreciate having access to Asian cuisine on campus. She’s also not one to turn down a Chick-fil-A sandwich every now and then.

Academically, Emily is a dedicated and high-achieving student with a strong background in science. She’s hoping to secure a scholarship to help with out-of-state tuition costs, as she comes from a middle-income family that values affordable education, her budget for tution is from $10000- $20000.

Emily’s ideal college experience involves being in a smaller city , where she can enjoy a slower pace of life and stay connected to the natural world. She thrives in environments that are more personal and less overwhelming.
